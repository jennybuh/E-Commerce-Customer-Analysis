# E-Commerce-Customer-Analysis

**Project Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing Amazon customer survey data to categorize shopping behaviors and preferences. Leveraging SQL for data transformation, Python for segmentation analysis, and Excel and Tableau for data visualization, the aim is to uncover key customer segments and derive actionable business insights. This personal project is in progress and seeks to inform business decisions by understanding consumer behavior in detail.

**Problem Statement**
In the competitive e-commerce sector, understanding evolving customer preferences is crucial. This analysis takes an exploratory approach to address the need to segment customers based on their Amazon survey responses, providing a foundation for targeted business strategies.

**Goals**

The primary goals are to:

**Identify and Define Customer Segments:** Categorize customers based on their shopping behaviors and preferences from survey data.
**Derive Actionable Business Insights:** Analyze the identified segments to provide a comprehensive Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) prediction, enabling efficient resource allocation and tailored strategy development.

**Stakeholder Needs**
The hypothetical/potential stakeholders include:

- E-commerce business strategists looking for data-driven insights
- Product managers seeking to understand customer preferences
- Marketing teams aiming to tailor strategies based on customer segments
- Setting Outcome Expectations
  
By the end of this analysis, the expectation is to:

- Define distinct customer segments within the Amazon shopper base
- Offer a CLV prediction for each segment to aid in strategic planning
- Provide descriptive summaries and visualizations that highlight key findings

**Tools/Technologies Used:**
- SQL: For data transformation and preparation.
- Python: Used for conducting segmentation analysis, specifically K-Means Clustering
- Excel and Tableau: For data visualization and presentation of findings
  
**Current Status**
Data Transformation: Manipulating survey data using SQL to prepare for analysis.
Next Steps: To proceed with segmentation analysis in Python and visualize findings in Excel and Tableau.
